I have completed the Heron classifier assignment by enhancing the existing code with a content-based fallback using a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model, added modular improvements, tests, Docker setup, and CI. I generated sample PDFs to showcase functionality, and the project can be tested using curl or Postman against the /classify_file endpoint.
